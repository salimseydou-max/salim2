Features
The application displays a clear title and a short description explaining its purpose. Users are presented with multiple-choice advice categories such as study, health, motivation, life, and money. These categories are shown as selectable buttons or cards to simplify decision-making. A “Get Advice” button allows users to request advice based on their selected category. The generated advice is displayed in a dedicated section and updates dynamically each time a request is made. The system also provides user feedback when no category is selected.

Technical Requirements
The application is built using React to manage the user interface and application state. State management is used to track the selected advice category and the generated advice content. Conditional logic controls when advice is displayed and ensures valid user selections before generating results. The application must support dynamic rendering to update content instantly in response to user actions. All functionality is handled within the application without page refreshes.
